# Rotation matrix between ZEMAX coordinate and Mirrior's coordinate.
# ZEMAX is used to generate/ evaluate the bending mode.
# Mirror's coordinate is used in the mirror's control system.

# The coordinate in FEA is the same as the MATLAB tool provided by Harris.
# It is different from the M2 control system.
# The (x, y, z)-axis in MATLAB is (-y, -x, -z) in LabVIEW

# +z in Bo's FEA (ZEMAX) is -z in M2 hardware.

# Rotation matrix from Bo's FEA model (ZEMAX) to Chris's FEA model (optical
# coordinate systems). The basis is the degree of freedom (DOF).
# 20 bending modes are listed here. This roation matrix is a diagonal matrix.

# The row is in the ZEMAX basis and the column is in the optical coordinate
# system.

bend: [1.0, -1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0,
        -1.0, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0]

# +z in Bo's FEA (ZEMAX) is -z in Chris's FEA (optical coordinate systems)
# for actuator force
act: -1.0

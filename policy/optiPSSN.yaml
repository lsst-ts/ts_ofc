# M1M3 actuator penalty factor
# how many microns of M2 piston does 1N rms force correspond to
# the bigger the number, the bigger the penalty
# 13.2584 below = 5900/445
# 445 means 445N, rms reaching 445N is as bad as M2 piston reaching 5900um
m1M3ActuatorPenalty: 13.2584

# M2 actuator penalty factor
# how many microns of M2 piston does 1N rms force correspond to
# the bigger the number, the bigger the penalty
# M2 F budget for AOS = 44N. 5900/44 = 134
m2ActuatorPenalty: 134

# penalty on control motion as a whole
# default below is 0.001, meaning 1N force is as bad as 0.001 increase in pssn
# use 0, if you accept whatever motion needed to produce best image quality
# use 1e100, if you absolutely hate anything that moves
motionPenalty: 0.001

# Rotation matrix between ZEMAX coordinate and optical coordinate systems
# defined in LTS-136.

# In ZEMAX coordinate, the hexapod position is (z', x', y', rx', ry'). +z' is
# defined from M2 to M1M3. +y' is defined as pointing toward zenith when the
# telescope is pointed toward the horizon (elevation angle is 0 degree).
# +x' follows by the right hand rule.
# x', y', and z' are in um. rx' and ry' are in the arcsec.

# In optical coordinate system, the hexapod position is (x, y, z, rx, ry, rz).
# +z is defined from M1M3 to M2. +y is defined as pointing toward zenith when
# the telescope is pointed toward the horizon (elevation angle is 0 degree).
# +x follows by the right hand rule.
# x, y, and z are in um. rx, ry, and rz are in the degree.

# For the rotation matrix below, row is (z', x', y', rx', ry') and column is
# (x, y, z, rx, ry, rz).

# 1 degree = 3600 arcsec
